A small Demo for a Paywall paid with ETH.

1. In /app run #npm install
3. Install MetaMask or any other Browser Wallet for Ethereum
4. Set the wallet Network to "Rinkeby TestNet"
5. Run npm start


(In a reallife application this project would probably work server-sided and not entirely by the client.)
